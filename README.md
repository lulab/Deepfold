# Deepfold
A tool for RNA secondary structure prediction with deep neural networks. DeepFold learn the underlying RNA folding mechanism directly from structure-known sequences without any energy assumption or parameters, and can also predict pseudoknots. It provides predicting scripts and models for input RNA ct file.
